# RayTracer [WIP]

A RayTracer written from scratch in Python.

## Introduction

Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics for rendering an image. It works by tracing light rays from an imaginary eye through every pixel
and simulating the effects of virtual objects on the light rays.

This repository is ment to contain a Python implementation of a ray tracer using nothing but the standard library. This is more of a proof of concept rather than something aiming for performance.
Such an implementation is a good exercise in test-driven development, and adhering to the Python data model.
